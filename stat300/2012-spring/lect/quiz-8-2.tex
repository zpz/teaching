Q1.
Pairs of P-values and significance levels, $\alpha$,
are given below. For each pair, state whether $H_0$ would be rejected at
the given significance level.
\begin{enumerate}
\item P-value: .084, $\alpha = .05$
\item P-value: .003, $\alpha = .001$
\item P-value: .498, $\alpha = .05$
\item P-value: .084, $\alpha = .10$
\item P-value: .039, $\alpha = .01$
\item P-value: .218, $\alpha = .10$
\end{enumerate}

Q2.
The paint used to make lines on roads must reflect enough light to be
clearly visible at night.
Let $\mu$ denote the true average reflectometer reading for a new type
of paint under consideration.
A random sample of size 9 from a normal population distribution is
obtained, with $\overline{x} = 22$ and $s = 3.2$.
Test $H_0: \mu=20$ versus $H_a: \mu > 20$ at significance level
$\alpha = 5\%$ following the steps below.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The hypotheses are:

\item Define a test statistic:
\[
T =
\]
\vskip10mm
\item The null distribution of the test statistic is:
\[
T \sim
\]
\vskip10mm
\item The value of $T$ based on the data is
\[
T^* =
\]
\vskip10mm
\item The P-value is:
