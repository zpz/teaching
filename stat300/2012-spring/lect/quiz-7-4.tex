Q1.
A journal article gave the following summary info
for fracture strengths (MPa) of $n=169$ ceramic bars fired
in a particular kiln: $\overline{x} = 89.10$, $s = 3.73$.
Calculate a confidence interval for true average fracture strength using
a confidence level of 95\%.

Q2.
A sample of 16 joint specimens of a particular type gave a sample mean
proportional limit stress of 8.48~MPa and a sample standard deviation of
.79~MPa.
Calculate and interpret a 95\% confidence interval for the true average
proportional limit stress of all such joints.
What, if any, assumptions did you make about the distribution of
proportional limit stress?
