Chapter 7 quiz, \today. Not to be graded. 10 minutes.

Suppose $X \sim \operatorname{Binom}(100, 0.1)$.
We want to use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
to calculate probabilities about $X$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item To justify the use of CLT, we need to argue that
    (1) $X$ is the sum (or mean) of an i.i.d.\@ sample of something, and
    (2) the sample size is large.
    Make these two arguments.
\item Use CLT and Table~A.3 to calculate (approximately)
    $P(X > 15)$, $P(X > 20)$, and $P(X > 30)$.
\end{enumerate}
