You may implement several more (nontrivial) functions,
if they are not available in R/stats, as drop-in replacement
of TSA functions. These may include
(1) coef conversion: MA->AR, AR->MA, ARMA->AR, ARMA->MA
(2) LS estimation of AR, MA, ARMA models with specified orders
(3) forecast with AR, MA, ARMA, giving prediction limits

Think carefully
(1) when separating AR, MA treatments from the general ARMA
is beneficial, and when making a general ARMA implementation to do all
is more convenient;
(2) how your AR and MA modules can be reused in a more
general ARMA function;
(3) what operations can be separated out as modular, utility functions to be
re-used in other functions
