STAT 611 HW 5
due Friday, 2/25

1. Write a R function, say, is.AR.stationary,
   that checks whether the AR process identified by the
   input vector of coefs (phi's) is stationary.

2. Write a R function computing the autocorrelation function
   of a ARMA(p,q) process, given the vectors of phi's and theta's.
   See page 85 and handouts.
   It should call the function above to check stationarity,
   and aborts if the process is not stationary.

   Construct a couple of examples to verify the correctness of your
   function by comparing its output with that of a known correct
   function.
