STAT 611 HW 4
Due Friday, 2/18

* 4.5

* 4.6

* 4.7

* 4.8 (I don't know what 'first principles' refer to; just use what we
    learned in this chapter)

* Construct 4 sets of coefficients for AR(3) or AR(4) processes such
  that 2 are stationary and 2 are nonstationary.
  Verify, using the 'stationarity conditions', that they are
  (non)stationary. Show a couple of simulations for each of these
  processes. Briefly comment on the behavior of the simulated
  realizations.

* List all the differences you can think of between MA and AR processes.
