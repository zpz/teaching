\maketitle

Due December 16 or earlier,
with a discussion on and demonstration of your program.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Implement the kernel density estimation algorithm
    in Zhang (2011), ``Iterative posterior inference for Bayesian
    kriging'', for 1-D in \textit{R}.

    Notes:
    (1) While the Zhang algorithm allows a weighted sample,
    you only need to consider a random sample.
    (2) As utilities for this implementation, you will need to
    implement functions for computing the density of a normal mixture
    and drawing random samples from a normal mixture.
    (3) The program will contain an optimization step, which you have
    practiced in a homework assignment.

\item Construct at least two examples to test and illustrate the
    performance of your implementation.
    For this purpose,
    you will need to make up a true normal mixture density,
    draw a random sample from it, and estimate the density based on the
    sample. Make plots to compare the true density and the estimated
    density.
\end{enumerate}
