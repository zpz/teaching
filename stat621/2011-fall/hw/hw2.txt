1.

Carefully read the parts of Section 3.1 about the Method A (the exact
method) for finding a confidence interval for the 'p' in a Binomial
experiment. The interval contains all 'p' values that will be accepted
in a TWO-SIDED test on the specified 1 - alpha level.
Let alpha = 0.05.

Write R code to implement this method.
Use Table A4 to verify your results.
For example:
    n = 7, X = 2:   (0.037, 0.710)
    n = 13, X = 10: (0.462, 0.950)
    n = 30, X = 5:  (0.056, 0.347)

Hint:
We know the interval will contain X/n.
Write an optimization function.
Run the function twice, searching for a solution
in the range (0, X/n) and (X/n, 1), respectively.

The optimization function needs an 'objective' to minimize?
What should we minimize?
Note that we want the p-value of the observed X to be close to 0.5.


2.
In a lab, insects of a certain type are released in the middle of a
circle drawn on a plain, flat table. A scent, intended to attract that
type of insect, is located at one end of the table. Each insect is
released singly and observed until it crosses the boundary of the
circle. At that time it is recorded whether the insect crossed the half
of the boundary "toward" the scent or the half "away" from the scent. At
the conclusion of the experiment, 33 insects went "toward" the scent, 16
went "away", and 12 did not cross the boundary within a reasonable time.
Does the scent attract those insects?

Test the following data to see if there is a significant correlation
between the yearly income of a family and the number of children in that
family.

22,212          1
22,635          4
... (data on page 177 of the book)

Conduct the test and make a plot if appropriate.


4.
Two landing fields 50 miles apart are observed for a one-year period to
determine whether there is a significant difference in availability due
to weather conditions. On 286 days both fields were open.
On 62 days both fields were closed. On 14 days Field A was closed while
Field B was open, and on 3 days the reverse was true.
Is there a significant difference in availability due to weather
conditions?
