STAT 621 HW 3
Assigned 10/17; due next Friday

1.
Contingency tables may be used to present data representing scales of
measurement higher than the nominal scale. For example, a random sample
of size 20 was selected from the graduate students who are U.S.
citizens, and their grade point averages were recorded:

2.42, 3.54, 3.21, 3.63, 3.22, 3.80, 3.70, 3.20, 3.75, 3.31
3.86, 4.00, 2.86, 2.92, 3.59, 2.91, 3.77, 2.70, 3.06, 3.30

Also, a random sample of 20 students was selected from the non-U.S.
citizen group of graduate students at the same university. Their grade
point averages were as follows.

3.50, 4.00, 3.43, 3.85, 3.84, 3.21, 3.58, 3.94, 3.48, 3.76
3.87, 2.93, 4.00, 3.37, 3.72, 4.00, 3.06, 3.92, 3.72, 3.91

Test the null hypothesis that the proportion of graduate students with
averages of 3.50 or higher is the same for both the U.S. citizens and
the non-U.S. citizens.


2.
A random sample of 30 graduating university seniors was categorized by
college and religious preference as follows. Is there a relationship
between college and religious preference?

Arts & Sciences: C[atholic], C, J[ewish], C, P[rotestant], P, O[ther],
P, O

Business: P, C, J, J, P, P, O

Engineering: C, P, P, P, O

Other: P, C, C, O, C, O, C, J, O


3.
Follow Example 3, page 210, to test independence of X and Y given a
scatter plot of X-Y pairs. Write R function(s) to implement this test.
Consider the following design issues:
(1) Write a function that takes parameters: x, y, nbin.x, nbin.y, etc
(2) It should return a list with info about x, y, nbin.x, nbin.y, the
test statistic, the p-value, degree of freedom, etc.
(3) Consider setting default values to 'nbin.x' and 'nbin.y' such that,
for example, they are equal and they are such that on average each cell
contains >= 4 points, say.

Functions that might be useful: sort, order, quantile, cut.

Run the code with several examples using data randomly drawn from
independent normal distributions, a dependent bivariate normal
distribution, and with a variety of sample sizes.

Show the scatter plots. Report the conclusions of your tests (mainly the
p-value).


4.
A die was cast 600 times with frequencies 87, 96, 108, 89, 122, 98 for
the faces 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Is the die balanced?
