STAT 621 HW 4

1. Prove the following statement:
If X and Y have a monotonic relation, then rank(X) and rank(Y) have a
linear relation.

2. Write an R function to calculate Kendall's tau, then call the
function with the data of Example 3, page 320, to get the result (0.4355).
In writing the function, you need to keep things like the sample size
general and handle possible ties in the data.
(Also refer to the lecture notes.)

3. Use R to implement the two topics in section 5.6, page 344, that is,
(1) predict Y for a particular X; (2) obtain a entire regression curve;
(3) plot the curve.
The implementation should keep things like sample size general, and
handle special situations such as ties and out-of-range predictors.
Make use of R functions related to linear regression.
(For interpolation, check out the function 'approx'.)
(Also refer to the lecture notes.)
With your R functions, plug in the data of Example 1, page 346, and
generate the Figure 4.
